## Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering

### Ph.D.

The [MAE PhD][mae-phd] curriculum consists of a set of courses in a "major" specialization (4) and a "minor" specialization (2), forming the basis of our qualifying exams. Much leeway is granted to the student, in discussion with their committee, in terms of how these courses are put together. Course descriptions can be found here: [MAE][mae], [ECE][ece], [MATH][math], and [GPS][gps]. Some courses that students in energy systems have taken include:
- Energy systems:
  - MAE 206 / GPGN 491. Energy Systems and Innovation
  - [MAE 207 (_new course FA20_). Electric Power Systems Modeling](/2020-09-03-new-course-mae207-power-systems-modeling/)
- Policy:
  - GPPS 428. Politics of Energy and Environmental Regulation
- Optimization:
	- MATH 271A-B-C. Numerical Optimization
	- ECE 273. Convex Optimization and Applications
- Numerical methods:
	- MAE 280A-B. Linear Systems Theory, Linear Control Design
	- MAE 290A–B. Numerical Methods for Linear Algebra, ODE Simulation, and Differential Equations
- Related courses:
	- MAE 254. Energy Materials and Applications
	- MAE 256. Radiative Transfer for Energy Applications

Students who already have funding or are actively seeking external funding are encouraged to contact me. For resources on potential funding opportunities, please visit [UCSD Graduate Division][grad-funding], [NSF GRFP][nsf-grfp], [International Students Office][ispo-funding], and this [resource for international students][caltech-funding]. All prospective students should consult the [admissions page][mae-phd-admissions] for deadline and application information.

### M.S.

Advising on relevant thesis research and other research opportunities for course credit are available to [MAE M.S.][mae-ms] students.

### B.S.

Undergraduates in [MAE][mae-bs] or across the school of engineering may inquire about participating in a research project. A minimum time commitment and high degree of motivation are required. Research can be for course credit, stipend, or hourly pay depending on the student’s preference and funding availability.

**Desired programming language competencies: python, R, and/or julia**
