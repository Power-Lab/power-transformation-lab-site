China, as the world’s largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, has announced an ambitious climate policy goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, which will require an unprecedented scale-up of low-carbon energy technologies. China’s variable renewable energy (VRE) deployment is historically imbalanced with large geographic concentrations driven by resource endowment and institutional heterogeneities. If continued, this pattern can run into deployment limits and exacerbate challenges associated with socio-economic benefits distribution, threatening the ability to timely integrate VRE. We develop a capacity expansion model with grid operational detail and high spatial resolution to examine decadal pathways to carbon neutrality by 2060 considering localized and temporal impacts. Over these four decades, we find that all regions will increase deployment rates of renewable energy, first driven by the use of high-quality resources, and later by coal retirement and electricity demand growth. The share of provinces with high deployment pressure, where deployment requirements exceed historical rates, increases from around 45% to 100% by the final decade. If carbon capture and storage (CCS) is not available, maximum annual average deployment rates will increase by 33% and occur a decade earlier. A more stringent 1.5 °C emission target leads to more acute temporal and spatial deployment pressures in the first decade, with VRE concentrated in regions with high-quality resources and demand centers and a doubling of new transmission capacity in the first decade. Effective national and subnational policy support is necessary to coordinate VRE deployment and facilitate transitions in impacted regions.</p>

We develop a capacity expansion model with grid operational detail and high spatial resolution to examine decadal pathways to carbon neutrality by 2060 considering localized and temporal impacts. Over these four decades, we find that all regions will increase deployment rates of renewable energy, first driven by the use of high-quality resources, and later by coal retirement and electricity demand growth. The share of provinces with high deployment pressure, where deployment requirements exceed historical rates, increases from around 45% to 100% by the final decade. If carbon capture and storage (CCS) is not available, maximum annual average deployment rates will increase by 33% and occur a decade earlier. A more stringent 1.5 °C emission target leads to more acute temporal and spatial deployment pressures in the first decade, with VRE concentrated in regions with high-quality resources and demand centers and a doubling of new transmission capacity in the first decade. Effective national and subnational policy support is necessary to coordinate VRE deployment and facilitate transitions in impacted regions.

We assess the critical mineral demand required to meet these goals using a bottom-up, scenario-based approach and examine how mineral bottlenecks affect sub-technology choices. Our analysis yields three key findings. First, annual demand for critical minerals is projected to rise 6-fold, from 4.7 million tons in 2022 to 30 million tons by 2030. Second, minerals such as natural graphite, cobalt, lithium, tellurium, indium, silver, aluminum, copper, and rare earth elements may face supply constraints. Third, specific sub-technologies depend heavily on certain minerals: cadmium and tellurium shortages could limit thin-film photovoltaics; indium scarcity may hinder perovskite tandem cells; rare earths are vital for permanent-magnet wind turbines; and lithium is a key for all-solid-state batteries. Improving material efficiency and advancing mineral-efficient technologies will be essential for a resilient energy transition.</p>

In practice, however, a reactor’s operational flexibility is closely tied to its fuel cycle and associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint for power maneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused from the transient buildup of neutron-absorbing xenon following a power reduction. This transient can delay or prevent subsequent power ramp-up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a reactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary significantly, leading to prolonged downtimes. This work introduces a physics-informed modeling framework that embeds fuel cycle dynamics within a unit commitment (UC) formulation. The framework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically enforces xenon induced constraints, and endogenously schedules refueling outages based on core conditions. By capturing intracycle reactivity evolution, the model enables operation dependent nuclear dispatch that reflects both techno-economic requirements and irreducible nuclear physics limits. Application to a representative reactor fleet shows that flexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles. Results further demonstrate that different operational modes substantially affect VRE utilization, curtailment, and nuclear fleet capacity factors. These findings highlight the importance of fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling for accurate reactor scheduling and integration of nuclear power into energy system models.</p>
