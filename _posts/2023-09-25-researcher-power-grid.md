Specifically, the Research Assistant will help manage the collection and validation of power system data, including transmission networks, generators, and demand profiles, and will have the opportunity to learn about and participate in various power system modeling projects using the data. A successful candidate will need to demonstrate a range of knowledge across the boundaries of electrical engineering, power systems, and programming. Fluency in Chinese language is preferred. Electricity markets or energy economics background is not required. An undergraduate engineering major would be preferred but not required.

Qualifications:
Python programming (Experience with Julia is a plus).

Hours per week:
10-15 hours/week
