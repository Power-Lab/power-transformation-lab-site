The Power Transformation Lab at UC San Diego studies the engineering and institutional requirements of deploying low-carbon energy at scale. We work across multiple geographies and with academic, government, civil society, and industry partners to advance research and solutions to climate and environmental challenges.

We are hiring several undergraduate Research Assistants (RAs) to contribute across various projects. RAs will support tasks such as data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and code development. Positions will be matched to student interests and skills. Please indicate preferred project or projects in your cover letter.

RA duties include:

- Implement data analysis techniques in Python/Julia for data collection and cleaning
- Perform basic quantitative analysis and assist with data visualization
- Develop project documentation and organize data sources
- Assist senior researchers with larger projects
- Collaborate with other RAs for lab development activities

Projects/topics available:

- **Southeast Asian countries’ decarbonization** - This project is analyzing decarbonization pathways for major Southeast Asian countries through the use of open datasets and analytical tools, and stakeholder engagement. The RA selected for this project will work on data collection and pre-processing to support power systems modeling projects in Southeast Asian countries.
- **China’s electricity market and open power data** - This project builds open analytical tools to investigate varied market designs and policy research questions in China’s power sector, supporting existing efforts such as the Electricity Market Tracker (https://emtracker.org/). The RA selected for this project will be responsible for reviewing websites, reports and documents related to China’s power sector, collecting and processing data to support research on electricity market reform and pathways toward the country’s dual carbon goals.
- **China’s energy transition under political-economic context** - This project investigates the underutilization of wind and solar power, known as curtailment, which is a persistent challenge in China's renewable energy sector: curtailment. We analyze the technical, economic, and political drivers of this recurring issue using power system modeling and political economy analysis to identify key barriers to the country's low-carbon transition. The RA selected for this project will work on collecting and pre-processing China’s power system data to support modeling and analytical research.
- **Database automation** - This project will support various activities within the lab that rely upon consistent and easily accessible datasets. The RA selected for this project will develop automation scripts for the lab's databases using Python and SQL, covering data extraction, transformation and loading. This project will deal with various types of data sources and may use AI tools for data collection and processing.
- **Clean Energy Customs Database**  - This project investigates the impact of changes in trade and industrial policies on trade flows of clean energy and eventual deployment. The RA selected for this project will assist in building the lab's trade customs database, including processing customs data and mapping granular customs codes across countries. This project will start with customs data from China and India and will be expanded to more countries in Asia and the U.S.
- **Western US decarbonization under socio-political context** - This project will focus on incorporating socio-political factors into a power systems model for the western US. Leveraging prior work completed in the Power Transformation Lab, socio-political factors most impactful to historical solar deployment in the US have been identified. This project will focus on how to operationalize these fundings with an energy justice lens. The RA selected for this project will work on collecting and pre-processing western US power system data to support modeling and analytical research.

Qualifications:

- Proficient in Python or Julia, especially in:
  - Extracting/scraping data from documents and websites
  - Data visualization
  - Basic statistical analysis
- Interest in conducting independent research
- Knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software is helpful but not required
- Knowledge of macro energy systems is a plus
- Knowledge of databases is a plus
- Experience with AI tools is a plus

Date Range:
October 2025 - June 2026
