DESCRIPTION
DEPARTMENT OVERVIEW:

The University of California’s only school of international affairs, the School of Global Policy & Strategy (GPS) provides a unique resource for training leaders, creating ideas, and building networks for the governance of globalization and its local impacts. GPS is internationally renowned for its innovative programs, superb faculty and outstanding students and now stands among the world's top graduate schools of international relations and is the established leader in its focus on Asia and the Americas. GPS instructs a diverse student body consisting of 60% domestic and 40% international students in MPP, MCEPA, MIA, BA-MIA, MAS, joint PhD with Department of Political Science and executive education programs. GPS also administers the International Studies Program, a fast-growing interdisciplinary program with over 1700 declared undergraduate majors, that offers a rigorous curriculum for undergraduate students interested in international affairs. Offering nine B.A. degree options, three combined BA/MIA programs, and a minor program, the International Studies Program explores the interaction between the international and national, global and local, contemporary and historical ideas shaping globalization. GPS is also the parent organization to major research centers: Center for Commerce and Diplomacy (CCD), Center on Global Transformation (CGT), Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies, 21st Century China Center, Fudan-UC Center on China, Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation (IGCC), Policy Design and Evaluation Lab (PDEL), Laboratory on International Law and Regulation (ILAR), and Japan Forum for Innovation and Technology (JFIT).

While China’s long-term goals of carbon neutrality have been set, there is considerable uncertainty about (a) the next decade, and (b) the pace, structure, and cost of low-carbon pathways. The transformation of the power sector-central to any decarbonization scenario-is hindered by entrenched incumbents and the institutional and engineering challenges of achieving the massive scale-up of renewable and low-carbon energy sources required. This requires the development of new modeling tools to capture physical resource, engineering, and political economy factors affecting the deployment of low-carbon energy.

POSITION OVERVIEW:

The Staff Research Associate will join a research team at the Power Transformation Lab consisting of postdoctoral researchers and students focusing on data collection and organization, modeling analysis, and writing on China’s electricity market developments and aligning market reforms with carbon neutrality. The team is focused on launching a new research and policy project aimed at developing open analytical capabilities of China’s power system together with international partners.

Under supervision, the position's key tasks include collecting and organizing detailed electricity market and grid data from various Chinese and English-language sources; developing modeling simulation tools (e.g., economic dispatch, capacity expansion optimizations) for typical market and administrative designs in China; independently addressing several policy-relevant research questions in the area of resource adequacy, spot markets and long-term contract design; and disseminating data, modeling results, and policy recommendations through a bilingual English-Chinese platform. The position will also contribute to broader Lab activities and development including regular attendance at research seminars, training and supervision of undergraduate researchers, documentation of Lab-wide shared resources. Attendance and presentations at, at minimum, one academic conference per year is expected. Perform other duties as assigned.

Must have proficiency in reading and writing in Chinese.

Overtime (evening or weekend) may be required based on needs.
