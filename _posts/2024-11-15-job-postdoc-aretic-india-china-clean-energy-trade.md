The 21st Century India Center at UC San Diego invites applications for a postdoctoral scholar to conduct research on the renewable energy trade relationship between India and China. This position focuses on understanding and analyzing the drivers, patterns, and implications of trade between the two countries in clean energy technologies.

Position Overview

The postdoctoral scholar will work under the joint mentorship of Professor Michael Davidson, Power Transformation Lab lead and Assistant Professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy and Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and Professor Teevrat Garg, Associate Professor at the School of Global Policy and Strategy and Lead of the Energy Transitions and Security in Emerging Economies (ETSEE) Initiative of the 21st Century India Center. The scholar will contribute to ongoing projects within the Agenda for Renewable Energy Trade in India-China (ARETIC).

This interdisciplinary role will involve the following key research areas:
- **Data Analysis and Trends**: Analyze trends in clean energy (CE) trade volumes, tariffs, global value chains and policy impacts using granular HS8 product code data, focusing on CE sectors including solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, batteries, and electric vehicles.
- **Policy Evaluation**: Examine the impact of policies such as tariffs, local content requirements, and the "Make in India" initiative on trade volumes, pricing, market shares, and domestic manufacturing capacity in CE.
- **Global and Domestic Market Implications**: Assess India’s competitive positioning in international CE markets, with an emphasis on its ability to scale manufacturing in response to geopolitical shifts like “de-risking” and “friendshoring.”
- **Strategic Development**: Collaborate with the ARETIC team to inform policy recommendations that support sustainable trade relations and CE sector growth in India.


Key Responsibilities

- Conduct data-driven research on trade patterns and policy impacts between India and China in CE.
- Publish findings in high-impact journals and contribute to white papers and policy briefs.
- Collaborate with an interdisciplinary team to leverage data for insights on trade patterns and market opportunities.
- Engage with stakeholders to translate research into actionable policy insights.

Qualifications
- Ph.D. in Economics, Public Policy, Environmental Studies, or a related field by the start date.
- Strong quantitative and econometric skills.
- Experience in trade policy, clean energy markets, or a related area.

This position offers the opportunity to contribute to a high-impact research agenda at the intersection of global trade and sustainable energy transition.
