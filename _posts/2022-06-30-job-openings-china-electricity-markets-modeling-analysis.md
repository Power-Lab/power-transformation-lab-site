## JOB OPENINGS: CHINA ELECTRICITY MARKETS MODELING AND ANALYSIS

University of California San Diego
June 2022

The UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) is hiring two research positions related to analyzing China’s electricity market developments and aligning market reforms with carbon neutrality. These positions will help launch a new research and policy project aimed at developing open analytical capabilities together with international partners. Key objectives:

- Collecting detailed electricity market and grid data, and developing modeling simulation tools for typical market and administrative designs in China
- Addressing several policy-relevant research questions in the area of resource adequacy
- Disseminating data, modeling results, and policy recommendations through a bilingual English-Chinese platform

The positions will be supervised by Michael Davidson, Assistant Professor in GPS and the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.

## 1	Postdoctoral Scholar, Open Analytical Capabilities to Support China’s Power Sector Reforms
The postdoc will be responsible for supporting the development of open-source modeling and simulation tools and will advise and assist in data collection. The postdoc should be well-versed in least-cost energy systems optimization models in one or more modeling languages (e.g., AMPL, GAMS, CVX, Julia/JuMP, Python/Pyomo). Familiarity with planning and operations power sector decision-making and/or electricity market design is preferred. Qualifications:
Ph.D. in a relevant field, demonstrated research ability and publication track record. Proficiency in Mandarin is a plus, but not required.
