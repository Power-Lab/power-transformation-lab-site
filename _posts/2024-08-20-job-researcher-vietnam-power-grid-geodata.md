## Research Assistant on Vietnam's Power Sector Decarbonization

The Power Transformation Lab (https://pwrlab.org/) is looking for a Research Assistant (RA) to work on the following research areas: Vietnam’s power system modeling, renewable energy resource assessment, and offshore wind development pathway analysis.
The common goal of these initiatives is to apply engineering principles with socioeconomic considerations to assess the development pathways for the decarbonization of power sectors in Vietnam, and possibly Southeast Asia more generally. The research often involves the construction of open-source power system models using data scraped from publicly available sources. The research may also involve analyzing institutional and policy factors in more developed energy markets to draw lessons for emerging markets. The results of this research are intended to inform strategies and policies for meeting long-term and short-term decarbonization targets, including Net Zero ambitions.

Research assistant duties include:
1.	Scrape, organize, and pipeline the data sources for modeling
2.	Assist with model construction and implementation in Python/Julia
3.	Perform basic quantitative and qualitative analysis of model results
4.	Visualize data and model results
5.	Conduct background research on topics related to renewable energy policies and development

Qualifications:
- Proficient in Python/Julia, especially in the following areas:
  - Scraping and cleaning data from documents and websites
  - Data visualization
  - Statistical analysis
- Interest in decarbonization goals, low-carbon energy technologies, and the power system
- Experience with GIS (especially QGIS) is helpful but not required
- Experience with computational models is helpful but not required
- Familiarity with Vietnam’s and regional energy policies is helpful but not required

## Research Assistant on Geodata Development

The Power Transformation Lab (https://pwrlab.org/) is developing the open-source python library geodata (https://github.com/GeodataTools/geodata) which streamlines the process of renewable energy resource assessment and siting analysis. It ingests multi-TB weather data and geospatial files, and calculates suitable locations and wind and solar power profiles that can be used in low-carbon power system studies. The Lab is looking for one or more programmers to work with ongoing research into renewable energy assessment in China, Southeast Asia, the U.S., and India, and on the following package improvements: expanding earth system model pipelines, adding spatial interpolation for arbitrary grid sizes, improving wind power estimations, Google Earth Engine integration, and improving package usability (continuous integration). New package features will be streamlined for use on the SDSC Triton Shared Computing Cluster (TSCC).


Qualifications:
- Proficient in Python, experience with package development and testing is helpful but not required
- Interest in decarbonization goals, low-carbon energy technologies, and the power system
- Experience with GIS (especially QGIS) is helpful but not required
- Experience with computational models is helpful but not required
