The Power Transformation Lab and the Regulatory Assistance Project have launched a new open data and model platform researching China's electricity market and policies. Electricity Market Tracker (EMT) is a multidimensional open data and model platform that supports in-depth research on Chinaâ€™s electricity market and policies. EMT tracks and analyzes the rapidly evolving power sector of China, offering perspectives and insights into the reform of power trading mechanisms. Well-designed trading mechanisms can support the construction of a reliable, efficient, clean, low-carbon, flexible, and intelligent power system.
