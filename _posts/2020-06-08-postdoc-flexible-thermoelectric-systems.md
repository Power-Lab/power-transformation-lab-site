## Postdoctoral Researcher, Flexible Thermo-Electric Systems
Department: Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering

Salary: Commensurate with experience

Appointment: 12 months (extendable based on mutual agreement and available funding)

Start Date: Flexible

The UC San Diego [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/) (MAE) is hiring a postdoctoral researcher to model the flexibility requirements of the power system under increasing penetrations of intermittent renewable energy, with a particular focus on thermo-electric systems. The postdoc should have a background in mechanical engineering or similar field, with expertise in combustion and pollution controls, power plant operations, and/or thermal storage. Experience with energy systems optimization and one or more modeling languages (e.g., AMPL, GAMS, Julia/JuMP, Python/Pyomo) is desirable. The fellow will work with the PI, Michael Davidson, assistant professor in MAE and the School of Global Policy and Strategy, who has ongoing projects with flexibility retrofits and large thermal fleets in China, and renewable integration studies in India, China, and the western US.

The postdoc will be fully integrated into the MAE community, a highly interdisciplinary engineering department. The fellow will also engage with other units at the Jacobs School of Engineering researching energy systems as well as the School of Global Policy and Strategy.


### Qualifications Required and Preferred Academic Background

All candidates must have a demonstrated research ability and publication track record. Must have a PhD in a relevant field. The 12-month appointment can be renewed based on funding and performance. Start date is expected to be between July and October 2020.

**To Apply: Submit a CV, a writing sample, a one-page personal statement of experience and career goals, and contact information for three references. Application must be submitted by email to mrdavidson [at] ucsd.edu, and include “Postdoc Application: Flexible Thermo-Electric Systems” in the subject line. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.**
