The Power Transformation Lab (https://pwrlab.org/) at the University of California San Diego is seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Research Scholar to contribute to a two-year project focused on helping Southeast and South Asian countries balance trade and investment with their decarbonization goals. The successful candidate will work with a team of researchers from the UCSD School of Global Policy and Strategy and Griffith University, and with numerous civil society organizations in the region.

The researchers will be fully integrated into the UCSD community, which includes a highly interdisciplinary school of public policy scholars, robust campus units researching power and energy systems, and a world-class think tank studying contemporary China.

## Research Focus

The project aims to identify and promote effective trade and investment policies to accelerate decarbonization. The research will involve:

- Data collection and modeling of trade, Chinese and non-Chinese investments, and localization policies in target geographies, including Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India.
- Collecting and analyzing existing clean energy trade and localization policies in Southeast and South Asia.
- Exploring the evolution of Chinese investments and alternative investment flows in shifting global value chains (GVCs) and export opportunities.
- Evaluating and preparing case studies where localization policies have successfully advanced or hindered decarbonization efforts.
- Proposing policy and investment strategies that balance localization objectives with decarbonization goals.
