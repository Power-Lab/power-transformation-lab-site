**Abstract**

Global wind resource assessments have benefitted in recent years from re-analysis datasets, which rely on a diverse collection of measurements and a global circulation model to reconstruct complete wind profiles. With high wind energy penetration, short-term and localized fluctuations are increasingly important relative to average annual availability for power systems planning and operation. Re-analysis methods have difficulty resolving these fluctuations, which are primarily driven by boundary layer atmospheric stability [1]. Leading methods to improve their accuracy such as downscaling are computationally expensive and geographically constrained [2]. Hence, tractable methods using available meso-scale data able to appropriately capture the fine temporal variability of wind farms distributed across large regions could improve siting, operation and policy for power systems.

Wind power densities were constructed from Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) boundary layer flux data produced by NASA at hourly resolution over a thirty-one-year period (1979-2009) [3]. We compared these data to several unassimilated wind measurement series and identified errors attributable to diurnal changes in boundary layer stability.
