Lab members Shiny Choudhury and Jenny Nicolas presented their research at the 2024 Doctoral Student Participatory Workshop on Climate and Energy Decision-Making (CEDM) on May 15-16. This event, hosted by Carnegie Mellon University at Pittsburg, is funded by the National Science Foundation. It attracts doctoral students working in the intersections of energy systems nationwide to come together and share their research and obtain feedback from CMU faculty. Shiny presented her work on ‘Harnessing flexibility of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs): A physics informed approach’, and Jenny presented her work on ‘Incorporating NIMBY-adjacent Values into the Solar Siting Process’.
