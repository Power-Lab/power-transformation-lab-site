Findings:
1. Close integration of global clean energy technology has benefited U.S. consumers and clean energy
deployment. Estimated cost savings from China’s participation in the global solar sector are in the range
$20-$30 billion over 2008-2020.
2. Manufacturing incentives through policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act, not tariffs, have been
responsible for the U.S. clean energy manufacturing renaissance in the past several years. Punitive trade
measures have been effectively countered by global value chains.
3. China’s leading clean energy firms, especially in solar, batteries and electric vehicles, are looking to invest
in and/or bring technology to the U.S., which would help relative latecomer U.S. firms and communities
reach the global technological frontier. However, these collaborations face an uncertain legal environment,
and there are no consistent practices for calibrating national security and supply chain risks.

Recommendations:
1. The U.S. should reduce barriers to clean energy foreign direct investment and technology use and transfer
agreements with Chinese firms. The U.S. government should establish a streamlined vetting process to
encourage adoption of leading technology and suppliers and establish targeted processes to mitigate
security risks. Protracted trade remedies should be used sparingly, in service of creating globally
competitive firms.
2. Washington should take steps to incentivize high returns to U.S. production and workers in all clean
technology collaborations. Technology sharing and use agreements should be encouraged as a form of
“reverse technology transfer” that reduces import dependencies. Investment collaborations should set
high local labor requirements, such as exceeding prevailing wages and worker protections.
3. U.S. trade authorities should review and update trade measures across clean energy supply chains. A
thorough review of successes and failures is needed, considering the type of trade measure, nature of the
technology, location in the value chain, and likelihood for retaliation. As more U.S.-based clean energy
manufacturing firms develop, the consequences of restricting global supplier networks should be carefully
monitored and policies adjusted.
