The Harvard Project on Climate Agreements and Tsinghua University’s Institute of Energy, Environment, and Economy conducted a research workshop on July 18–19, 2019. A wide variety of presentations ([available here](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/harvard-project-conducts-research-workshop-beijing)) from Chinese and international experts covered how subnational actions--including China's ETS--can enhance climate change policy design and implementation.
