## Power and Energy Systems @ UCSD

The [Power and Energy Systems Group @ UCSD][ucsd-pes] is designed to integrate power and energy systems research/programs and enhance the community of power and energy systems researchers on campus. We facilitate collaborations among students and faculty across departments/centers, provide feedback to students' work through biweekly meetings, and provide graduate student career mentoring.


## Other Opportunities

### Postdoctoral Fellows

We are always interested in recruiting talented postdocs from different disciplines. Interested applicants should consult the [UCSD Office of Postdoctoral Affairs][postdoc] for appointment information, and the [Office of Foundation Relations][foundation], the [National Academies][NAS], and [this resource][harvard-funding] for funding opportunities.

**The [University of California President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/) is a competitive program that offers fellowships, professional development and faculty mentoring to outstanding scholars in all fields whose research, teaching, and service will contribute to diversity and equal opportunity at UC. Applications are due November 1.**

If you would like to be considered for future funded opportunities, you may contact Prof. Davidson with your interests and expected graduation date.

### Science Policy Fellows Program

Prof. Davidson is a faculty mentor with the [Science Policy Fellows Program][science-policy], operated out of GPS. Ph.D. candidates in engineering, medicine, or at Scripps, may apply to be paired with a mentor to work on a policy project related to the student's doctoral research. This generally involves meeting a few times per quarter and comes with a small stipend, e.g., to attend a conference outside of the student's primary academic discipline.
