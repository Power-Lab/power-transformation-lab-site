**We are recruiting PhD and MS students to join the lab.** Please include in your inquiry (**{{ site.author.email }}**):

- CV and transcript(s)
- Research interests (the team's [research areas](research.html) are a good start to see what we do, but we are interested in what you want to do)
- If you are a fellowship recipient with funding


## School of Global Policy & Strategy

### Masters degrees

GPS offers a variety of [masters degrees][gps-masters]. The [admissions office][gps-admissions] will be better prepared to answer questions on the differences among the programs. A limited number of research assistantships may become available for GPS masters students on an ad-hoc basis.

Interested students are highly encouraged to take relevant energy policy courses, including:
- GPPS 428 (Winter, Davidson). Politics of Energy and Environmental Regulation
- GPPA 472 (Fall, Martin). Latin American Environmental and Energy Policy
- GPPS 473 (Fall, Herberg). Political Economy of Energy in Asia
- GPPS 490 (Winter, Davidson). Energy and Environmental Policy in Asia

For life tips on a career in energy policy, [Dan Kammen's website][kammen] is a good start.

### Joint Ph.D. in Political Science and International Affairs

The Department of Political Science and GPS offer a joint [Ph.D. in Political Science and International Affairs][gps-phd]. This prepares students for careers in political science, including a core curriculum shared with the political science Ph.D. degree.

## Power and Energy Systems @ UCSD

The [Power and Energy Systems Group @ UCSD][ucsd-pes] is designed to integrate power and energy systems research/programs and enhance the community of power and energy systems researchers on campus. We facilitate collaborations among students and faculty across departments/centers, provide feedback to students' work through biweekly meetings, and provide graduate student career mentoring.


## Course schedules

The UCSD Schedule of Classes is somewhat difficult to navigate, so here is a set of "quickview" scripts to find out when classes are typically taught and what your favorite profs are teaching: [ucsd-class-schedule-quickview][git-quickview]

## Other Opportunities

### Postdoctoral Fellows

We are always interested in recruiting talented postdocs from different disciplines. Interested applicants should consult the [UCSD Office of Postdoctoral Affairs][postdoc] for appointment information, and the [Office of Foundation Relations][foundation], the [National Academies][NAS], and [this resource][harvard-funding] for funding opportunities.

**The [University of California President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/) is a competitive program that offers fellowships, professional development and faculty mentoring to outstanding scholars in all fields whose research, teaching, and service will contribute to diversity and equal opportunity at UC. Applications are due November 1.**

If you would like to be considered for future funded opportunities, you may contact Prof. Davidson with your interests and expected graduation date.

### Science Policy Fellows Program

Prof. Davidson is a faculty mentor with the [Science Policy Fellows Program][science-policy], operated out of GPS. Ph.D. candidates in engineering, medicine, or at Scripps, may apply to be paired with a mentor to work on a policy project related to the student's doctoral research. This generally involves meeting a few times per quarter and comes with a small stipend, e.g., to attend a conference outside of the student's primary academic discipline.
