  <p>
  The Power Transformation Lab at the University of California, San Diego studies the engineering and institutional requirements of deploying low-carbon energy at scale. We work with academic, government, civil society, and industry partners to advance research and solutions to climate and environmental challenges centering on the role of the power grid. Our areas of focus include renewable energy resource planning, affordable and reliable low-carbon power markets, and the political economy of industrial policy and low-carbon transitions in firms.
