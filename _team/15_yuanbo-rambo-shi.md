I am a data science major 2021er with a specialization in data analysis, data mining, machine learning and deep learning. I am currently in the Geodata group implementing methods for masks and related computations on geospatial data. I am interested in applying data analysis to solve various social problems. I love playing my guitar and singing when Iâ€™m free.
