I am an associate professor in the [School of Global Policy and Strategy](http://gps.ucsd.edu/) and the [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department](http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego. I study the engineering implications, institutional conflicts and global value chains inherent in deploying low-carbon energy at scale. See our [research areas](research/) and [papers](publications/) for more details.

I am a faculty member with the [21st Century China Center][21ccc] (where I run a project on Chinese energy markets with the [China Data Lab][cdl]), the [21st Century India Center][21cic], the [Center for Commerce and Diplomacy][ccd],  the [Japan Forum for Innovation and Technology][jfit], and the [Computational Social Science program][css], all located at UC San Diego, and the UC-wide [Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation][igcc]. I am a senior associate (non-resident) with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the [Center for Strategic and International Studies][csis]. I am a member of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and am an alum of the [Penn Project on the Future of U.S.-China Relations][penn] and the [Public Intellectuals Program at the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations][ncuscrpip].

Previously, I was a post-doctoral research fellow in the [Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs][belfer], and received my Ph.D. in engineering systems and an S.M. in technology and policy from the [MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society][idss], where I was a researcher with the [MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](http://globalchange.mit.edu). Prior to MIT, I worked for the [Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/) and was a Fulbright fellow in the [Tsinghua University Department of Energy and Power Engineering](http://www.te.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/teen/index.html). I received bachelors degrees in Mathematics and Physics and in Japanese Studies from Case Western Reserve University.
