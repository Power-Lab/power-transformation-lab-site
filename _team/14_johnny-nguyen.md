I am a Mechanical Engineering major with a specialization in Renewable Energy and Environmental Flows at UC San Diego. I am most interested in exploring the intersection of policy and engineering principles in my education and research and am currently working on the Western Clean Energy project. When I am not on campus, you can find me exploring coffee shops and eateries around the city.
