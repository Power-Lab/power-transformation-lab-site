I’m a fourth year Data Science major at UC San Diego. I’m interested in data mining and machine learning. At Davidson Lab, I’m working on scraping Chinese electricity market data of various modalities from websites and data ETL. My hobbies are playing basketball, working out, and watching anime shows.
