Tereza is a Ph.D. student in Political Science at UC San Diego, focusing on the political economy of the energy transition. Her research examines how politics at the federal, state, and local levels shapes the siting and deployment of renewable energy, and how the spread of clean energy in turn influences political dynamics. She studies topics such as renewable energy investments, interconnection queues, and regional electricity market governance. Prior to UC San Diego, Tereza earned a B.A. in Economics from NYU Abu Dhabi. In her free time, she enjoys yoga, visiting national parks, and learning languages.
