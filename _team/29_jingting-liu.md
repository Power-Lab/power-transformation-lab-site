I am a second year ECE student majoring in Computer Engineering at UCSD. My interests are in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. In the Davidson Lab, I assist with the validation and reproduction of open to public data in the China Electricity Market project. In my free time, I like to eat and explore different kinds of activities such as singing, playing video games, and running.
