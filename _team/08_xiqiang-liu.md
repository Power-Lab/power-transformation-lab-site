I am a fourth-year Data Science student with experience in data analysis and machine learning. At Davidson Lab, I am working on the Geodata project under the guidance of Professor Davidson, where I am currently creating an interface for efficient wind speed modeling. Additionally, I have also added various features, trying to make the overall analysis process easier to use for users with user-friendly prompts and interfaces.
