I am a third year international student from Malaysia! Majoring in Data Science with a Minor in Math. At the Power Lab I am working with Jenny Nicolas on the Solar NIMBY Project, assisting her with visualizing spatial data, performing robustness checks and creating models to help with understanding the social effects on Solar Panel construction. In my free time I love to go swimming, running or Rock Climbing, but if I am in my room I am probably paying video games!
