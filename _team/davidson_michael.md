I am an assistant professor in the [School of Global Policy and Strategy](http://gps.ucsd.edu/) and the [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department](http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego. I study the engineering implications and institutional conflicts inherent in deploying low-carbon energy at scale. See my [research areas](/research/) and [papers](/papers/) for more details.

I am a faculty member with the [21st Century China Center][21ccc] (where I run a project on Chinese energy markets with the [China Data Lab](cdl)), the [Center for Commerce and Diplomacy][ccd], and the [Japan Forum for Innovation and Technology][jfit], all located at UC San Diego. I am currently a fellow with the [Public Intellectuals Program at the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations](https://www.ncuscr.org/program/public-intellectuals-program) and the [Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy](http://sais-isep.org/) at Johns Hopkins SAIS. I am an affiliate with the [UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation][igcc].

Previously, I was a post-doctoral research fellow in the [Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs][belfer], and received my Ph.D. in engineering systems and an S.M. in technology and policy from the [MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/), where I was a researcher with the [MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](http://globalchange.mit.edu). Prior to MIT, I worked for the [Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/) and was a Fulbright fellow in the [Tsinghua University Department of Energy and Power Engineering](http://www.te.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/teen/index.html). I received bachelors degrees in Mathematics and Physics and in Japanese Studies from Case Western Reserve University.
