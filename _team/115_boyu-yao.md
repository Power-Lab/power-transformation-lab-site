I am a full-time Research Associate at the Davidson Lab where I focus on assisting the production of open and reproducible datasets and models for China's power system. My academic passions center around increasing the penetration of renewable energy into the system and exploring the related market mechanisms. Prior to joining the Davidson Lab, I earned my Master's degree in Environmental Health and Engineering from Johns Hopkins University, where I gained valuable experiences in energy modeling. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in various activities such as playing the piano, participating in soccer games, and exercising at the gym.
