I'm a Data Science major and a Math minor at UCSD. Some of my educational interests, particularly in Data Science, are machine learning and scalable analytics. I have also done research in the genetics field studying differential gene expression of mental disorders like Alzheimer's and exploring their genetic causes. In the Davidson Lab, I have been working on adding aggregation functionality to the Geodata Python package, as well as performing a project to find feasible areas for solar energy grids in China.
