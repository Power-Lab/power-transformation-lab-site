I am a third year student at UCSD majoring in Math-Economics and minoring in Data Science. I am interested in the stories behind the data and hope to use my knowledge of econometrics and machine learning algorithms to dig deeper into the information behind the data. Currently, I am working on the China Energy SOE team, analyzing corporate-level finances and researching employee replacement in China to achieve low-carbon economy goals. In my spare time, I enjoy working out with friends and preparing cuisines from around the world.
