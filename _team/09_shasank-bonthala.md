I am a third-year Data Science student working with the renewable energy forecasts team. My interest in research comes from how data can tell stories. Individuals can use the same data set and based on their own interpretations, come to different conclusions and that is fascinating to me. I am a huge sports fan (literally any sport) and in my free time I love watching sports (basketball and football being my favorites). I am also a die hard Laker fan!
