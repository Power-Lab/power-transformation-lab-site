I'm a fourth year undergraduate student in the Data Science program. I have long been passionate about sustainability & climate, data analysis, and art. Working with the geodata team in the Davidson lab has allowed me explore the confluence of these interests and expand my knowledge. I am currently conducting research on renewable resource assessment and planning in India through geospatial data analysis. My work attempts to answer pertinent questions regarding the extent to which prioritizing political suitability influences wind and solar potential in India.
