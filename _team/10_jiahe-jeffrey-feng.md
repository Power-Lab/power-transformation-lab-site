I am a Data Science & Cognitive Science major (class of 2022) with experience in the fields of data analysis, data engineering, and machine learning. I am working on the Geodata Team for the Davidson lab, where I am implementing functions to manipulate and visualize geospatial masks and shapefiles. I am enthusiastic about data and how we can efficiently solve problems with it, and am planning to attend graduate school in data science.
