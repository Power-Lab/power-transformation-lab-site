I am a second-year Master of Chinese Economics and Political Affairs student, with a focus on Chinese economics and industrial policy. I am interested in pursuing a career as a research analyst, since I am passionate about researching the impact of regulation and the interaction between government and enterprises on industry as well as macroeconomics. Working with Professor Davison on the low-carbon transition of the Chinese energy state-owned enterprises is providing me with an excellent opportunity to expand my research interests in renewable energy policies.
