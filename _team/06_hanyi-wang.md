I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at UC San Diego. My research leverages causal inference techniques to assess the cost-effectiveness, distributional consequences, and broader trade implications of climate policies on firms. Additionally, I delve into understanding the impact of sustainable investing on businesses and how regulatory pressures can drive green transitions. Prior to this, I earned an MPhil in Land Economy Research from the University of Cambridge and a B.S. in Applied Math from UC San Diego.
