I am a fourth-year student majoring in Data Science & Joint Major of Mathematics and Economics. I am currently working on data extraction and analysis with the China Power Market team in Dr. Davidson's lab. We are streamlining the workflow of scraping data from multiple sources and types. My personal interest is exploring how could data can help market decisions.
